# Paint Project - Geometry and Logic Concepts

This is a project developed during the 6th semester of my college course. The main goal was to create a basic Paint application to apply concepts of geometry and improve programming logic.

## Project Reflection

Am I proud of this code? Not particularly, but it represents an important step in my coding journey and shows how much I've evolved since then.

## How to Run

To execute the project, simply open the `menu.html` file. Alternatively, if you want to explore an older version, you can open `index.html`.

## Why JavaScript?

I chose JavaScript because I believed it was a good language for studying logic, especially if you already have a basic understanding of typed languages. Additionally, JavaScript was easy to execute in a browser. Despite many professors and friends advising against it, claiming that "JavaScript is very bad," I was one of the few groups that managed to deliver a complete project.
